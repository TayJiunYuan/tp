## Implementation
### Add module
The Add Module features allows users to add two types of modules (taken or planning) to the ModuleList using the commands `plan` or `taken`. The two types of modules are differentiated by its `Module()` overloaded constructor, accepting different type signatures. It is facilitated by `ModuleList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the 2 types of modules and how the add module mechanism behaves at each step.

**When a planned module is added:**
Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The ModuleList will be initialised with the initial module list state if provided in `penus.txt`.

Step 2. The user executes the `plan CS2113 y/1 s/2` command to plan the module CS2113 for year 1 and semester 2 to be added into the list. The `plan` command is executed within the switch case of the `parseCommand()` method of `CommandParser`.

Step 3. If a valid command is provided, a new `Module` will be instantiated within `ModuleParser` where another switch case is executed. The `ModuleParser` is extracted away from the `CommandParser` for more readability. The string is then split into parts separated by the flags `y/` and `s/` into a `planDetails` array. An overloaded constructor `Module()` is instantiated with the arguments corresponding to the array which sets the `isTaken` parameter `false`. The arguments are `moduleCode`, `year` and `semester`.

Step 4. The new `Module` object is then returned to the `CommandParser` where it is assigned and added to the `ModuleList`. The `addModule()` method is then executed in `ModuleList`. 

Step 5. It first checks if the module already exists in the list by iterating through the current list and checking for the same `moduleCode`. If so, `DuplicateModuleException` is thrown. If the module does not exist, it is added to the `ModuleList` by calling the `add()` method of the class. 

Step 6. A confirmation message is prited to indicate the success of the module addition. This is called using the `printMessage()` method from `Ui` which accpets an array of strings as message lines.

**When a taken module is added:**
Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The ModuleList will be initialised with the initial module list state if provided in `penus.txt`.

Step 2. The user executes the `taken CS2113 y/1 s/2 g/A+` command to plan the module CS2113 for year 1 and semester 2 to be added into the list. The `plan` command is executed within the switch case of the `parseCommand()` method of `CommandParser`.

Step 3. If a valid command is provided, a new `Module` will be instantiated within `ModuleParser` where another switch case is executed. The `ModuleParser` is extracted away from the `CommandParser` for more readability. The string is then split into parts separated by the flags `y/`, `s/` and `g/` into a `takenDetails` array. An overloaded constructor `Module()` is instantiated with the arguments corresponding to the array which sets the `isTaken` parameter `true`. The arguments are `moduleCode`, `year`, `semester` and `grade`.

Step 4 - 6. Identical to that of a `plan` command as mentioned above.

### Display status
The Display Status feature `status` lists all the core modules in the user's course, and indicates which ones the user has or has
not taken. The feature also displays the total number of MCs the user has taken. 

Given below is an example of how `status` is called at each step.

Step 1: The user executes the `status` command to check his current graduation status. The `status` command is executed
within the switch case of the `parseCommand()` method of the `CommandParser`. The Command Parser will then call 
`printStatus()` of the `ModuleList` class.

Step 2: When `printStatus()` is first executed, the method calls `getTakenCoreModsList()` and `getUntakenCoreModsList()` 
to return a list of string of core module codes that the user has taken/not taken respectively. `getTakenCoreModList()` and 
`getUntakenCoreModsList()` work by first retrieving the list of all core mods from the Resource Manager class through the`getCoreMods()` 
method, which returns a hashmap with the course as the key and list of string of core module codes. In order to get
the core module codes of the user's course, the user's course is retrieved from the `User` class, at which the 
attribute `course` is given by the user on initialization. An exception is thus triggered if the user calls `status()` 
without initialising. By giving the key as the user's course, the list of core modules is retrieved. For 
`getTakenCoreModsList()`, the list of core module 
codes is then compared with the all the modules taken by the user in `modules` to return the list of core modules codes that the
user has/ has not taken. 

Step 3: In order to get the status of GE modules, the printStatus() method then calls 3 methods, `getGESS()`, `getGEN()` and
`getGEC()` , which loops through the user's `modules` and check if the user has taken those modules and returns the module code 
if taken. 

Step 4: The printStatus() then prints the list of taken/ untaken by calling the `printStatusFunction()`. The `printStatusFunction()` method
takes in each module's code retrieves the title and MCs through `ModuleRetriever` class, then prints it out.

Step 5: Lastly, the printStatus() method calls `numberOfMcs()`, retrieves each module's MC through the `Module Retriever`
class and returns the totals number of MCs. The printStatus() method then prints the total number of MCs / 160.

### Product scope

#### Target user profile
- NUS engineering students
- prefers desktop CLI over other available planner application(s)
- prefers typing to mouse interactions

#### Value proposition
Manage a planner faster and more efficiently than a typical mouse/GUI driven application

### Use cases

### Non-Functional Requirements
- PENUS should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java 11 or above installed.
- PENUS should be able to hold up to 1000 modules without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
- A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
